# Gender-representation-in-video-games

A statistical analysis of gender representation in video games using the language R on a data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/br33sa/gender-representation-in-video-games).
We use statistical learning to uncover various ways in which the female and non-female characters (including male, non-binary and custom) are portrayed, identify prevalent stereotypes, and analyse how different gender identities are represented in video games
